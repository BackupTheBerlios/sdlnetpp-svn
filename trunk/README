								   SDL_net++

									 (NPP)

								 Version 1.0.0

This is a C++ wrapper for SDL_net, which is available at:
	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
	
It therefore requires SDL and SDL_net to be installed somewhere...

SDL_net++ is written in C++.

The current version supports Linux, though it may work on others

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  This license allows you to use SDL_net++
freely in commercial programs as long as you link with a dynamic
library, or make relinking with a static/dynamic library possible.

The best way to learn how to use SDL_net++ is to check out the header files in
the "src" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.

The test programs in the "test" subdirectory are in the public domain.

If you need help with the library, or just want to discuss SDL related
issues, you can join the #SDL channel at irc.freenode.org

Enjoy!
