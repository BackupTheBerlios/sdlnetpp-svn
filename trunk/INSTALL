                         SDL_net++ Installation "Guide"

1) edit config.mak

    check that SDL_PREFIX and SDL_NET_PREFIX make sense for where you have
        them installed.  The default should find SDL if it is already in 
        your path.  It assumes SDL_net is in the same place.

    change the INSTALL paths if you hate them.  It defaults to the same
        locations that SDL is located.

    change RANLIB to "true" is you don't need ranlib.

    uncomment EXE if you need .exe (or other) suffixes on programs.

2) make

    this should make everything...including the tests :)

3) try the programs in the "test" dir...make sure you have fun...
    at least make sure they sorta work...

4) (optional) make install

    on some platforms this requires root or other administrative privilidges.
        this sometimes depends on the INSTALL locations.

    this will place all the headers into the INSTALL dir prefix (config.mak)
    
    the tests are NOT installed of course...

5) send me pancakes...

    okay, this is also optional...
    
6) you are ready to use SDL_net++ from the INSTALL prefix.

    #include "SDL_net++.h"

    int main()
    {
        if(!NPP::init())
            NPP::error("NPP init");
        ... do stuff ;) ...
    }

    compile with the INSTALL_INCDIR in your include path.
    example:
            c++ `sdl-config --cflags`  -c source.cc 

    link to the SDL_net++ library in the INSTALL_LIBDIR.
    example:
            c++ -o program *.o `sdl-config --libs` -lSDL_net++

    run program :)

    rinse of bugs and repeat.

7) why are you at step 7, only you can live the rest of your life.

8) look now...the instructions have been over for awhile...

9) ok so, how are you?  I haven't instructed you in a while.

10) glad to hear that you are ok, maybe sleep deprived, but hey, aren't we all.

11) ok, I have to go now. <click>
